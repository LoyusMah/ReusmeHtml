    <h2>Summery</h2>
    <p>With five years of managerial experience as a store manager,
        I've honed my skills in leadership, problem-solving, and team
        management. Now, I'm embarking on an exciting new journey to
        transition my career into full-stack development.
        During my time as a store manager, I've cultivated a strong
        foundation in organizational efficiency, project management, and
        customer-centric solutions. These skills are transferrable and
        complement the technical abilities required in software development.
        Motivated by a passion for technology and a desire to innovate,
        I've embarked on a journey to become a full-stack developer. I'm
        currently enhancing my proficiency in programming languages such
        as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js.
        Additionally, I'm delving into databases, server management, and
        version control systems to build a comprehensive understanding of
        full-stack development.
        My experience as a store manager has instilled in me a disciplined
        work ethic, effective communication skills, and the ability to thrive
        in fast-paced environments. These qualities, combined with my
        burgeoning technical expertise, position me as a valuable asset in
        the field of full-stack development.
        I am enthusiastic about leveraging my diverse background to
        contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with cross-functional
        teams, and continuously grow as a professional in the dynamic world
        of technology.</p>
